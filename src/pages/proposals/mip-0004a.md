## 3. Confidentiality

### A. **_Definition of Confidential Information. “Confidential Information”_**

During and after the term of this Agreement, Consultant will hold in the strictest confidence, and take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information, and Consultant will not (i) use the Confidential Information for any purpose whatsoever other than as necessary for the performance of the Services on behalf of DAOLABS, or (ii) disclose the Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent of an authorized representative of DAOLABS, except that Consultant may disclose Confidential Information to any third party on a need-to-know basis for the purposes of Consultant performing the Services; provided, however, that such third party is subject to written non-use and non-disclosure obligations at least as protective of DAOLABS and the Confidential Information as this Article 3. Consultant may also disclose Confidential Information to the extent compelled by applicable law; provided however, prior to such disclosure, Consultant shall provide prior written notice to DAOLABS and seek a protective order or such similar confidential protection as may be available under applicable law. Consultant agrees that no ownership of Confidential Information is conveyed to the Consultant. Without limiting the foregoing, Consultant shall not use or disclose any DAOLABS property, intellectual property rights, trade secrets or other proprietary know-how of DAOLABS to invent, author, make, develop, design, or otherwise enable others to invent, author, make, develop, or design identical or substantially similar designs as those developed under this Agreement for any third party. Consultant agrees that Consultant’s obligations under this Section 3.B shall continue after the termination of this Agreement.

Consultant also agrees that Consultant will not bring onto DAOLABS’s premises or transfer onto DAOLABS’s technology systems any unpublished document, proprietary information, or trade secrets belonging to any third party unless disclosure to, and use by, DAOLABS has been consented to in writing by such third party.

### D. **_Third Party Confidential Information._**

Consultant recognizes that DAOLABS has received and in the future will receive from third parties their confidential or proprietary information subject to a duty on DAOLABS’s part to maintain the confidentiality of such information and to use it only for certain limited purposes. Consultant agrees that at all times during the term of this Agreement and thereafter, Consultant owes DAOLABS and such third parties a duty to hold all such confidential or proprietary information in the strictest confidence and not to use it or to disclose it to any person, firm, corporation, or other third party except as necessary in carrying out the Services for DAOLABS consistent with DAOLABS’s agreement with such third party.

Consultant will not incorporate any invention, improvement, development, concept, discovery, work of authorship or other proprietary information owned by any third party into any Invention without DAOLABS’s prior written permission.

### C. **_Moral Rights._**

Any assignment to DAOLABS of Inventions includes all rights of attribution, paternity, integrity, modification, disclosure and withdrawal, and any other rights throughout the world that may be known as or referred to as “moral rights,” “artist’s rights,” “droit moral,” or the like (collectively, **_“Moral Rights”_**). To the extent that Moral Rights cannot be assigned under applicable law, Consultant hereby waives and agrees not to enforce any and all Moral Rights, including, without limitation, any limitation on subsequent modification, to the extent permitted under applicable law.

### D. **_Maintenance of Records._**

The records will be in the form of notes, sketches, drawings, electronic files, reports, or any other format that is customary in the industry and/or otherwise specified by DAOLABS. Such records are and remain the sole property of DAOLABS at all times and upon DAOLABS’s request, Consultant shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) the same.

### E. **_Further Assurances._**

Consultant agrees to assist DAOLABS, or its designee, at DAOLABS’s expense, in every proper way to secure DAOLABS’s rights in Inventions in any and all countries, including the disclosure to DAOLABS of all pertinent information and data with respect thereto, the execution of all applications, specifications, oaths, assignments and all other instruments that DAOLABS may deem necessary in order to apply for, register, obtain, maintain, defend, and enforce such rights, and in order to deliver, assign and convey to DAOLABS, its successors, assigns and nominees the sole and exclusive right, title, and interest in and to all Inventions and testifying in a suit or other proceeding relating to such Inventions. Consultant further agrees that Consultant’s obligations under this Section 4.E shall continue after the termination of this Agreement.

### F. **_Attorney-in-Fact._**

Consultant agrees that, if DAOLABS is unable because of Consultant’s unavailability, dissolution, mental or physical incapacity, or for any other reason, to secure Consultant’s signature with respect to any Inventions, including, without limitation, for the purpose of applying for or pursuing any application for any United States or foreign patents or mask work or copyright registrations covering the Inventions assigned to DAOLABS in Section 4.A, then Consultant hereby irrevocably designates and appoints DAOLABS and its duly authorized officers and agents as Consultant’s agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and on Consultant’s behalf to execute and file any papers and oaths and to do all other lawfully permitted acts with respect to such Inventions to further the prosecution and issuance of patents, copyright and mask work registrations with the same legal force and effect as if executed by Consultant.

or other third-parties performing Services under this Agreement to execute a Confidential Information and Assignment Agreement in the form of Exhibit B, and promptly provide a copy of each such executed agreement to DAOLABS.
