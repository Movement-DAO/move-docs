## 1. Thesis

As the DAO community has directed, and as **dao-lawfirm.eth**, the DAO Service Provider, has concurred, **the DAO should establish formal entities which are legally recognized by both regulatory bodies and financial institutions to allow the DAO to fully realize its potential and purpose.** Therefore, the DAO must provide Member authorizations to its Member as well as explicitly receive authorization and consent from the Community Members.

## 2. DAOLABS Group

The DAO ratified the establishment of the following affiliates: **DAOLABS, LLC.**, **DAOLABS, INC.** and any permutations thereof, as well as the establishment of **PeaceDAO Unincorporated Nonprofit Association**.

This proposal ratifies the actions of certain individuals to formalize the **DAOs** as either a Washington or Delaware entity, establish the DAO's banking account, and register the DAO's affiliates, including **DAOLABS, LLC**, **DAOLABS, Inc.** and any permutations thereof, together which are referred to herein as the **"DAO Group"** or **"DAO affiliates"**.

## 3. Abstract

The DAO Members should ratify the indemnification of certain individuals who have acted on behalf of the DAO in various capacities: legal and accounting, including the disbursing of funds at the behest of other Members, the community, or for the benefit of the DAO.

## 4. Authorization of "Meatspace" Activities

Authorize **tankbottoms.eth**, **goodtimeswith.fuzzyhandcuffs.eth** or **benreed.eth**, and **jimmyethworld.eth**,[^1] and the individuals, entities, addresses, and contracts mentioned in the Guiding Principals's _7. Clarification_ to act on the DAO Group's behest, ratified by the DAO Members, with all matters related to establishing legal entities, financial registration, and registration with any regulatory bodies or financial institutions, and fully authorize the aforementioned Members in all matters in furtherance of these activities. Futhermore, the DAO Group requires onboarding and accounting relationships with third party Cryptocurrency processor companies, intellectual property matters, and other matters related to the inter-group relationship with financing, intellectual property licensing, copyright and registration, and regulatory activities associated with any significant fundraising activities. Future issuance of tokens, options, and stock are also authorized.
