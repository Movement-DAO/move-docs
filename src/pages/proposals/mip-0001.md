## Thesis

Ratify and adopt the DAO's [Guiding Principles](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/legal/guiding-principles), [Terms of Service](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/legal/tos), and [Code of Conduct](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/resources/code-of-conduct).

Guiding Principles: Establish the DAO as an Unincorporated Nonprofit Association pursuant to the [Delaware Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act](https://delcode.delaware.gov/title6/c019/index.html).
Terms of Service: An agreement between the DAO and parties who use the DAO's services or resources.
Code of Conduct: Defines community member standards and community enforcement guidelines.

## Motivation

The DAO seeks clarity with regard to legal structure and its relationship between its members and non-members alike. These agreements contribute to a healthy, transparent and well functioning organization while addressing the lack of clear legal standing as a DAO. The community conduct guidelines establishes expectations of member conduct. The Terms of Service establishes the agreement between the DAO and non-members.

## Specification

Ratify and adopt Movement DAO's [Guiding Principles](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/legal/guiding-principles), [Terms of Service](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/legal/tos), and [Code of Conduct](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/resources/code-of-conduct).

Update Movement DAO's [Discord server](https://discord.gg/movexyz), [docs](https://gov.move.xyz), and other relevant resources to reflect these changes.

## Rationale

Ratifying the Guiding Principles establishes an Unincorporated Nonprofit Association, which, in turn, will:

-   recognize the DAO's entity in the eyes of the law;
-   allow the DAO to create bank accounts, hold property, and enter agreements;
-   substantially reduce contributor liability;
-   clarify membership and the DAO's internal processes;
-   improve the DAO's legal compliance; and,
-   removes ambiguity regarding its intellectual property.

The Terms of Service will clarify:

-   the DAO's privacy policy.
-   the DAO's governing laws and conflict resolution processes.
-   Risks associated with DAO's online resources.
-   Notify users of the DAO's resources their responsibility legally, financially, and ethically.

The Code of Conduct will implement:

-   Community standards emphasizing honesty, inclusion, and respect.
-   Enforcement guidelines for members who violate these standards.

## Risks

-   By forming an Unincorporated Nonprofit Association, Movement DAO may incur taxes.
-   These documents may not adequately address Movement DAO's legal concerns.
-   These documents are long and may be difficult to read.

## Timeline

These documents should be implemented once this proposal is ratified, only to be removed when superseded or amend
ed by another proposal.
