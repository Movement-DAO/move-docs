## Thesis

Ratify and adopt the DAO's [Guiding Principles](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/legal/guiding-principles), [Terms of Service](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/legal/tos), and [Code of Conduct](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/resources/code-of-conduct).

1. Guiding Principles: Establish the DAO as an Unincorporated Nonprofit Association pursuant to the [Delaware Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act](https://delcode.delaware.gov/title6/c019/index.html).
2. Terms of Service: An agreement between the DAO and parties who use the DAO's services or resources.
3. Code of Conduct: Defines community member standards and community enforcement guidelines.

## Motivation

The DAO seeks clarity with regards to legal structure and the relationship between its members and non-members alike. These agreements contribute to a healthy, transparent and well functioning organization while addressing the lack of clear legal guidance regarding "DAOs". The Community Conduct Guidelines establish expectations for all members' conduct. The Terms of Service establishes the agreement between the DAO and non-members.

## Specification

Ratify and adopt the DAO's [Guiding Principles](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/legal/guiding-principles), [Terms of Service](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/legal/tos), and [Code of Conduct](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/resources/code-of-conduct).

Update DAO's [Discord server](https://discord.gg/movexyz), [docs](https://gov.move.xyz), and other relevant resources to reflect these changes.

## Rationale

Ratifying the Guiding Principles establishes an Unincorporated Nonprofit Association, which, in turn, will:

- recognize the DAO's legal standing as an entity;
- allow the DAO to hold accounts, property, and enter into agreements;
- clarify membership processes, e.g. define duties owed to each other;
- adopt the Unincorporated Nonprofit Association model act language, where appropriate;
- establish and adopt unique and specific terms with regards to the DAO's structure, operations, and ownership of property;
- adopt the role of the Service Provider and the activities authorized; and
- remove ambiguity generally, i.e. regarding its intellectual property.

The Terms of Service will clarify the DAO's:

- requirement for parties interacting with the DAO's application and resources to take full responsibility;
- unambiguous position on the DAO's adherence to state and federal statues;
- risks associated with reliance and deference to the technology employed in the DAO's operation;
- conditions of use, demand for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations (including U.S. Securities law, Office of Foreign Assets Control compliance, etc.);
- explicit prohibited activities (including activities which are illegal or harmful to the DAO or its members);
- limitations in liability, and disclaimers by the DAO;
- requirement for indemnification by the user under certain circumstances;
- requirement for the user to promise not to sue the DAO, or its members;
- language regarding arbitration, and processes for dispute resolution;
- process on computation of damages, attorney fee's, and notice via Blockscan;
- privacy policy, including a verbose general warning on blockchain usage;
- risks associated with DAO's online resources; and
- users' legal, financial, and ethical responsibilities when using the DAO's resources.

The Code of Conduct will state the DAO's position with regards to:

- requirements for members to unequivocally be honest;
- community standards emphasizing honesty, inclusion, and respect; and
- enforcement guidelines for members who violate these standards.

## Risks

- By forming an Unincorporated Nonprofit Association, Movement DAO may incur taxes.
- These documents may not adequately address Movement DAO's legal concerns.
- These documents are long and may be difficult to read.

## Timeline

These documents should be implemented once this proposal is ratified, only to be removed when superseded or amend
ed by another proposal.
