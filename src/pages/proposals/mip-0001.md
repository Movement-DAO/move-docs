## Thesis

Ratify and adopt Movement DAO's [Guiding Principles](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/legal/guiding-principles), [Terms of Service](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/legal/tos), and [Code of Conduct](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/resources/code-of-conduct).

Guiding Principles: Establish Movement DAO as an Unincorporated Nonprofit Association pursuant to the [Delaware Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act](https://delcode.delaware.gov/title6/c019/index.html).
Terms of Service: An agreement between the DAO and individuals or groups who use the DAO's services or resources.
Code of Conduct: Defines community standards and community enforcement guidelines.

## Motivation

Currently, Movement DAO does not have clear legal structure, terms of use, or community conduct guidelines. These documents will contribute to transparency and clarity while addressing the DAO's immediate legal concerns.

## Specification

Ratify and adopt Movement DAO's [Guiding Principles](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/legal/guiding-principles), [Terms of Service](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/legal/tos), and [Code of Conduct](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/resources/code-of-conduct).

Update Movement DAO's [Discord server](https://discord.gg/movexyz), [docs](https://gov.move.xyz), and other relevant resources to reflect these changes.

## Rationale

Ratifying the Guiding Principles will establish an Unincorporated Nonprofit Association, which will:
- Limit contributor liability.
- Allow the DAO to create bank accounts, hold property, and enter agreements.
- Clarify membership and the DAO's internal processes.
- Improve Movement DAO's Legal Compliance.
- Clarify the ways in which Movement DAO can use intellectual property.

The Terms of Service will clarify:
- The ways in which individuals can interact with Movement DAO's online resources.
- Movement DAO's privacy policy.
- Movement DAO's governing laws and arbitration rules.
- Risks associated with Movement DAO's online resources.

The Code of Conduct will implement:
- Community standards emphasizing honesty, inclusion, and respect.
- Enforcement guidelines for members who violate these standards.

## Risks

- By forming an Unincorporated Nonprofit Association, Movement DAO may incur taxes.
- These documents may not adequately address Movement DAO's legal concerns.
- These documents are long and may be difficult to read.

## Timeline

These documents should be implemented once this proposal is ratified, only to be removed when superseded or amend
ed by another proposal.
