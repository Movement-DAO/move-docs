## Thesis

The DAO and its affiliates should establish a direct banking relationship so that it may integrate its Dapp with payment processors and accept payments in fiat currency; the DAO has integrated Bolt using internally generated API keys and Wyre API keys both which require checking accounts to connect and fulfill account loading functions. A DAO's affiliate, **Ramp**, have business models where they offer full service start-up services such as cap-table, profit and losses, and other organizational services normally left to the start-up's devices.

In order for a financial institution to establish a banking relationship with the `DAO`, the `DAO` must be able to provide this information detailed within the "Actions by the DAO Snapshot Consensus by the Members" (the equivalent of Majority Shareholder Consent) section. Unlike traditional entities with shareholder meetings, the DAO must adopt modern tools such as using Snapshot to vote Project Tokens or arbitrary NFTs, or a hybrid of them both.

## Motivation

The DAO's fiat contributions are currently facilitated by the `DAO's Service Provider`, `dao-lawfirm.eth`, via manual funds transfers and conversion from Cryptocurrency to fiat and vice versa using personal CryptoAccounts, likely generating gains or unforeseen tax liability which will need to be mitigated.

## Resolution

See Exhibit A. DAO RESOLUTION TO OPEN A BANK ACCOUNT

## Actions by the DAO Snapshot Consensus by the Members

Whereas the DAO through its Members voted to adopt the following actions via Snapshot and resolves as follows:

**RESOLVED:** That the Service Provider, together with `dao-lawfirm.eth`, `tankbottoms.eth`, `benreed.eth` shall be authorized on behalf of the DAO, and its Members, to establish a banking relationship with Chase Bank and other service providers to facilitate additional payment services required by the DAO.

<!--

2. establish EIN, government accounts
3. sign up for Bolt, Wyre, Ramp,
4. Transfer expenses to a DAOLABs card
5. Establish DAOLABS and the banking relationship

**RESOLVED FURTHER:** That, in accordance with the powers of the Service Provider specified in the DAO's Guiding Principals, the Member's `tankbottoms.eth` and `benreed.eth` of the DAO are authorized to execute and deliver any payments or agreement in the name of the DAO and to otherwise obligate the DAO with respect to the activities of the Company, within general guidelines and budgets approved by the DAO Members; provided, however, that the Board Members may adopt from time to time specific limitations on the authority of such Service Providers.

**RESOLVED FURTHER:** That the DAO Members in consultation with legal counsel are authorized and directed to execute, verify and file all documents, and to take whatever actions, that are necessary or advisable to comply with all state and federal securities laws.
