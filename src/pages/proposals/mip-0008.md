## Thesis

Expand Movement DAO's Multisig ([`0x143cC0A996De329C1C5723Ee4F15D2a40c1203c6`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x143cC0A996De329C1C5723Ee4F15D2a40c1203c6)) by adding the following signers:

|Name|ENS|Address|
|-|-|-|
|tankbottoms|tankbottoms.eth|[`0x5d95baebb8412ad827287240a5c281e3bb30d27e`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5d95baebb8412ad827287240a5c281e3bb30d27e)|
|jango|jango.eth|[`0x823b92d6a4b2AED4b15675c7917c9f922ea8ADAD`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x823b92d6a4b2aed4b15675c7917c9f922ea8adad)|

And updating the Safe threshold to 6 out of 9 in accordance with the [Multisig Process](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/governance/multisig).

## Motivation

Movement DAO's Multisig currently has 5 Signers and a Safe threshold of 3, which centralizes execution. As Movement DAO's onchain activities expand, having a large team of competent signers will be increasingly important. The proposed signers all have experience queuing, verifying, and executing transactions in Gnosis Safes.

## Specification

Multisig to:
1. Add `0x5d95baebb8412ad827287240a5c281e3bb30d27e` as a signer and update the Safe threshold to 4 of 6 signers.
2. Add `0x823b92d6a4b2AED4b15675c7917c9f922ea8ADAD` as a signer and update the Safe threshold to 5 of 7 signers.
3. Add `0x30670d81e487c80b9edc54370e6eaf943b6eab39` as a signer and update the Safe threshold to 5 of 8 signers.
4. Add `` as a signer and update the Safe threshold to 6 of 9 signers.

Prospective Multisig signers must agree to the [Multisig Process](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/governance/multisig) before being added to the Movement Multisig.

## Rationale

The `GnosisSafeProxy` smart contract does not allow for multiple signers to be added at once, so signers must be added one at a time.

## Risks

The new signers might make mistakes or poor decisions.

## Timeline

These signers should be added to the Multisig indefinitely, until this proposal is revoked or otherwise amended by another proposal. The multisig should continue expanding over time.
