## Thesis

The DAO Dapp requires technical development, documentation, legal documentation, a user interface, branding, and additional features before being deployed. The timeline, costs, and scope are estimates based on current expenses and are subject to change.

This proposal constitutes the first draw from the DAO's treasury, and will bootstrap the DAO's product development and clarify legal boundaries:

The multisig shall transfer 1,500,000 DAI to developer.movedao.eth ([`0x2187e6a7c765777d50213346F0Fe519fCA706fbD`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2187e6a7c765777d50213346F0Fe519fCA706fbD)) to pay for 4 months of product development, transitional development expenses, community-building resources, legal services, accounting, branding, and design resources, including retroactive reimbursements and expenses borne by dao-lawfirm.eth, tankbottoms.eth, ryan-breslow.eth.

This one-time payment will support the DAO as it ramps up the development of tooling, documentation, and structures to support the DAO's growth. Additionally, the recruiting of a product program manager, meatspace entity management, and accounting support will be covered by this payment.

#### Current Prototypes

- The [Treasury Juicebox Dapp](https://juicebox.wtf/). This frontend and backend constitute a complete re-implementation of the [Peel Juicebox frontend](https://juicebox.money). Not only does it feature several experimental features built from scratchâ€”it also compiles to a fraction of the Peel frontend's size, and is implemented from the ground up as components.
- The [Identity Juicebox Dapp](https://identity-develop.web.app/) features an expansive identification featureset. It allows users to connect with cryptocurrency wallets, SMS authentication, Google, eMail, Facebook, GitHub, or Twitter, or to connect anonymously. By adding multiple authentication services, users can generate a custodial cryptocurrency account. This Dapp also employs multi-party computation to secure a wallet's seed phrase and private keys, and integrations to connect existing Gnosis Safes or to deploy new ones. Additionally, this frontend provides cryptocurrency on-ramps and off-ramps through credit cards, debit cards, and ACH transfers.

## Motivation

Currently, payouts are privately funded, development and staffing is inconsistent, processes are opaque and invoke major overhead for contributors, and these process are primarly managed by tankbottoms.eth, his private company Meow, and dao-lawfirm.eth.

This first budget will allow the DAO to transition expenses to the appropriate entity, with greater transparency. This will also allow for the delegation of recruiting efforts including diverse payout schemes, the management of diverse cryptocurrency on-ramp and off-ramp requirements, and intellectual property concerns via DAO affiliates such as DAOLABS, LLC.

dao-lawfirm.eth has recommended continued use of multsigs to distribute funds due to the DAO's large DAI holdings and a lack of DAI support within the Juicebox Protocol.

## Specification

| id  | role      | ethereum address                                                    | monthly budget | annualized | governance tokens | notes |
| --- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| 1   | developer | [developer.movedao.eth](0x2187e6a7c765777d50213346F0Fe519fCA706fbD) | 500,000        | 6,000,000  | 0                 |       |

The DAO and its advisors have reached a consensus that there will partner legal entities to provide form and discrete functions as the vision of an open treasury and governance application. The unincorporated non-profit DAO will service as outreach for those needs in public goods are unserved by the for-profit motives, the DAO will have non-exclusive rights to the intellectual property of the product. Contributors to the DAO Gnosis will be eligible to receive membership tokens by which to participate in the governance of the DAO.

To service the needs of the product intellectual property the formation of DAOLABS, LLC was formed to retain the intellectual property developed to date and to engage with development staff to continue with the development of the product. The intellectual property will be licensed to DAOLABS, Inc a for-profit corporation which will execute the for-profit function of the product including the relationships with payment processor providers, cryptocurrency on-off-ramp providers, and other data services for which the product requires. Additionally, the DAOLABS, Inc will distribute options to individual contributors and stock to financial contributors including potential future investors.

### Bootstrap expenses

-   establish the DAO as an Delaware UNA, a registered legal entity;
-   establish an accounting, tax reporting, structure for the DAO wrt on/off-ramp services;
-   establish for-profit reg. in support the DAO's mission, e.g. DAOLABS, LLC, Inc.;
-   establish intellectual property protection rights for the DAO, wrt DAOLABS, LLC, Inc,;
-   transfer all current expenses borne by dao-lawfirm.eth, and any other entity to the DAO;
-   provide 3 months of proposed expenses, as detailed below;

### Proposed Budget

## Rationale:

To support this proposal, I have:

-   Support

## Risks

- Transparent operation of the DAO uncertain with the entity structure undetermined
- Juicebox DAI terminal has not been deployed to mainnet
- These funds may not be ideally distributed.
- These funds may be more useful later on.
- The DAO is delegating major responsibility by approving a budget for 3 months, which increases risk.
