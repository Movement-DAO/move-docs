## Thesis

The DAO Dapp requires technical development, documentation, legal documentation, a user interface, branding, and additional features before being deployed. The timeline, costs, and scope are estimates based on current expenses and are subject to change.

This proposal constitutes the first draw from the DAO's treasury, and will bootstrap the DAO's product development and clarify legal boundaries:

The DAO Multisig shall transfer 1,500,000 DAI to developer.movedao.eth[^1] to pay for 4 months of product development, transitional development expenses, community-building resources, legal services, accounting, branding, and design resources, including retroactive reimbursements and expenses borne by dao-lawfirm.eth, tankbottoms.eth, and ryan-breslow.eth.

This one-time payment will support the DAO as it ramps up the development of tooling, documentation, and structures to support the DAO's growth. Additionally, the recruiting of a product program manager, meatspace entity management, and accounting support will be covered by this payment.

#### Current Prototypes

-   The [Treasury Juicebox Dapp](https://juicebox.wtf/). This frontend and backend constitute a complete re-implementation of the [Peel Juicebox frontend](https://juicebox.money). Not only does it feature several experimental features built from scratch—it also compiles to a fraction of the Peel frontend's size, and is implemented from the ground up as Svelte components.
-   The [Identity Juicebox Dapp](https://identity-develop.web.app/) features an expansive identification feature set. It allows users to connect with cryptocurrency wallets, SMS authentication, Google, eMail, Facebook, GitHub, or Twitter, or to connect anonymously. By adding multiple authentication services, users can generate a custodial cryptocurrency account. This Dapp also employs multi-party computation to secure a wallet's seed phrase and private keys, and integrations to connect existing Gnosis Safes or to deploy new ones. Additionally, this frontend provides cryptocurrency on-ramps and off-ramps through credit cards, debit cards, and ACH transfers.
-   [tiles.wtf](https://tiles.wtf) is a re-implementation of [tiles.art](https://tiles.art), which was an infinite generative NFT art project. tiles.wtf improves upon tiles.art by creating the art entirely on the Ethereum blockchain as SVG files (as opposed to using an API service), and also implementing a Juicebox treasury dashboard and donations page.
-   [Juicebox Matic](https://matic.tankbottoms.xyz/) is a re-implementation of [juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money) on the Polygon blockchain.
-   [Membership NFT + Juicebox DAO](https://membership.juicebox.wtf/) is a Juicebox frontend tailored towards creating treasuries funded by customizable tiered membership NFTs. This frontend builds upon earlier work at [nft.juicebox.wtf](https://nft.juicebox.wtf/).
-   [Bleeding Edge](https://bleeding-edge.juicebox.wtf/) is a Juicebox Protocol frontend featuring customizable user pages and multiple no-code NFT collection creation workflows.
-   [Staging Juicebox](https://staging.juicebox.wtf/) features further experimental features, such as a scrolling homepage and a project category selection menu.

## Motivation

Currently, payouts are privately funded, development and staffing is inconsistent, processes are opaque and invoke major overhead for contributors, and these process are primarly managed by tankbottoms.eth, his private company Meow, and dao-lawfirm.eth.

This first budget will allow the DAO to transition expenses to the appropriate entity, with greater transparency. This will also allow for the delegation of recruiting efforts including diverse payout schemes, the management of diverse cryptocurrency on-ramp and off-ramp requirements, and intellectual property concerns via DAO affiliates such as DAOLABS, LLC.

dao-lawfirm.eth has recommended continued use of multsigs to distribute funds due to the DAO's large DAI holdings and a lack of DAI support within the Juicebox Protocol.

## Specification

### Multisig

The [Movement DAO Multisig](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/governance/multisig) shall transfer 1,500,000 DAI to developer.movedao.eth ([`0x2187e6a7c765777d50213346F0Fe519fCA706fbD`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2187e6a7c765777d50213346F0Fe519fCA706fbD)), a Gnosis Safe which has the following five signers:

1. [`0x752515a3A1091b9f1c04416CF79D1F14d2340085`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x752515a3A1091b9f1c04416CF79D1F14d2340085) _(dao-lawfirm.eth)_
2. [`0x468f178672C86bFA02e5E1B0413C3ccf55A37409`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x468f178672C86bFA02e5E1B0413C3ccf55A37409)
3. [`0x550bD0F03580B9a687931af4d837F8e45D61d410`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x550bD0F03580B9a687931af4d837F8e45D61d410)
4. [`0xDbE76F6ae97dFD5bdd1D7DAD8972740d18aB2b57`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xDbE76F6ae97dFD5bdd1D7DAD8972740d18aB2b57)
5. [`0x746cf650d4E5431474E8D4E2d5B6Bbe53772b498`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x746cf650d4E5431474E8D4E2d5B6Bbe53772b498)

### Proposed Budget

### Utilization

Developer budgeting decisions will be made at the discretion of tankbottoms.eth and dao-lawfirm.eth, with participation from two community members. Business development budgeting decisions will be made at the discretion of jimmyethworld.eth and dao-lawfirm.eth. Additional signers will be added after a probationary period of 20-90 days to ensure that the DAO's interests are being represented.

### Entities

The DAO and its advisors have agreed to utilize multiple partnered legal entities to achieve the DAO's goals.

1. The DAO Unincorporated Nonprofit Association will execute non-profit functions of the DAO, provide public goods, and have non-exclusive rights to intellectual property associated with the product. Contributors to the DAO Gnosis will be eligible to receive membership tokens with which those contributors can participate in DAO governance.
2. DAOLABS, LLC was formed to retain intellectual property developed to date and to engage with development staff.
3. That intellectual property will be licensed to DAOLABS, Inc—a for-profit corporation which will execute for-profit functions of the product, including relationships with payment processor providers, relationships with cryptocurrency on-ramp and off-ramp providers, and other data services which the product requires. Additionally, DAOLABS, Inc will distribute options to individual contributors and stock to financial contributors, including potential future investors.

### Bootstrap expenses

-   establish the DAO as an Delaware UNA, a registered legal entity;
-   establish an accounting, tax reporting, structure for the DAO wrt on/off-ramp services;
-   establish for-profit reg. in support the DAO's mission, e.g. DAOLABS, LLC, Inc.;
-   establish intellectual property protection rights for the DAO, wrt DAOLABS, LLC, Inc,;
-   transfer all current expenses borne by dao-lawfirm.eth, and any other entity to the DAO;
-   provide 3 months of proposed expenses, as detailed below;

### Proposed Budget

## Rationale:

To support this proposal, I have:

-   Support

## Risks

-   Transparent operation of the DAO uncertain with the entity structure undetermined
-   Juicebox DAI terminal has not been deployed to mainnet
-   These funds may not be ideally distributed.
-   These funds may be more useful later on.
-   The DAO is delegating major responsibility by approving a budget for 3 months, which increases risk.
