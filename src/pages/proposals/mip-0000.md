## Thesis

Ratify and adopt the [Movement DAO Governance Process](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/governance/process) and the [Movement DAO Multisig Process](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/governance/multisig).

## Motivation

Currently, Movement DAO does not have robust governance processes. Adopting these processes will:
- Add clear governance utility to [MAPE NFTs](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdd407a053fa45172079916431d06e8e07f655042).
- Grant donors and contributors a stronger voice in the DAO's decision making processes.
- Allow Movement DAO to formally ratify decisions and processes, improving the DAO's clarity and transparency.
- Pave the way for further proposals to address the DAO's legal status, treasury management, budgeting, and more.

Perhaps most importantly, clear governance will allow the DAO to bootstrap development of the Move Platform.

## Specification

Ratify and adopt the [Movement DAO Governance Process](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/governance/process) and the [Movement DAO Multisig Process](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/governance/multisig).

Update the DAO's [Snapshot spaces](https://snapshot.org/#/movedao.eth), [docs](https://gov.move.xyz), [Discord server](https://discord.gg/movexyz), and other relevant resources to reflect these changes.

## Rationale

The Governance Process:
- is simple, reducing ambiguity, loopholes, and confusion. This encourages participation.
- takes place in public. It is transparent and promotes accountability.
- leaves complexity to individual proposals, allowing the DAO to be adaptable. The process can be amended to meet the DAO's needs over time.
- allows for gradual progress towards an expanded multisig and eventual onchain governance.

The Multisig Process:
- is also simple and easy to understand, leading to similar benefits.
- has safety mechanisms in place (the dao-lawfirm.eth removal) but does not overly centralize execution. New members must be added through standard governance processes.
- balances community participation without sacrificing duty of care.

Both processes contain safeguards, including oversight from dao-lawfirm.eth, to protect the DAO from bad actors.

## Risks

- These processes rely on sound distribution of MAPE NFTs, as well as sound multisig membership.
- Poor decision making, malicious behaviour, or bias from the multisig could prove disastrous. Multisig membership should expand over time.
- Poor decision making, non-constructive feedback, bad proposals, and lopsided participation could lead to poor outcomes.
- The process has high thresholds, meaning only well-liked proposals will pass. This is by design.
- Proposals may take several weeks to pass, meaning the DAO must delegate day-to-day complexities.
- The process inherits risks of democracy, human nature, etc.

## Timeline

These processes should be implemented once this proposal passes a 7-day Snapshot vote in the DAO's [Consensus Space](https://snapshot.org/#/snapshot.movedao.eth), only to be removed when superseded or amended by another proposal.
