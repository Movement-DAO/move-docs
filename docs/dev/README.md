Welcome all developers to the Movement DAO docs.

Movement DAO's affiliate, DAOLABS, is building a powerful suite of tools for web3 communities: flexible enough to operate at any scale, with powerful token issuance, treasury management, fiat compatibility, governance, and legal compliance out of the box. Movement DAO is working with DAOLABS to offer these web3 tools to non-profits, charities, and public good projects.

Whether you are a developer looking to build on top of the platform, an auditor, or are just looking to learn solidity and contract design, these docs should help you to understand the platform and its underlying smart contracts.
