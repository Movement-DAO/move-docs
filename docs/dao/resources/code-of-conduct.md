This is the Code of Conduct for DAO and its Community. Some terms used in this document have specific meanings, and are defined in the [Definitions](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/legal/definitions).

## Community.

Before being admitted as a DAO Member, each individual must accept the DAO's Code of Conduct, the DAO's Community Enforcement Guidelines, the DAO's [Guiding Principals](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/legal/guiding-principles), and the DAO's [Terms of Service](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/legal/tos).

In the event of a breach of the Code of Conduct, or a breach of any applicable terms and conditions, the DAO reserves the right to remove the associated DAO Member(s) without notice.

Views, statements and opinions expressed by a DAO Member do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the DAO Association or any of its affiliated entities, and shall be considered individual and personal statements of that DAO Member. The DAO shall not in any case be held responsible for any views, statements or opinions of any kind expressed by the DAO Member.

Every Member must act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, and inclusive Community. By participating in the Community, every Member agrees to make our Community a harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. Any behavior contrary to this spirit of tolerance is unacceptable, and those acting in such a way will be immediately excluded from the Dapp, and prevented from any and all privileges granted to DAO Members.
