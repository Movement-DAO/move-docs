title: Governance Process
sidebar_position: 1
---

The DAO is governed by its community, as expressed through MAPE NFT voting.[^1]

[Multi-sig](multisig) transactions and signatures, as well as updates to DAO processes, must be ratified by this process prior to their implementation.

## Phase 0: Discussion.

Authors are encouraged to create a proposal discussion thread in the `#✍️｜proposal-workshop` channel of the [DAO Discord](https://discord.gg/movexyz) to receive the community's feedback.

:::tip
You can use the [proposal template](template) as a starting point. When writing your proposal, try to be as detailed as possible in your specification. Only include what is necessary—short, specific proposals are best.
:::

## Phase 1: Temperature Check.

Once finalized, authors can submit their proposals to the DAO's [Temperature Check Space](https://snapshot.org/#/movedao.eth). The Temperature Check Space grants addresses one vote per MAPE NFT.

As the DAO's Service Provider, [dao-lawfirm.eth](https://dao-lawfirm.xyz/) maintains the right to revoke Temperature Check proposals which are malicious, exploitative, or otherwise in bad faith.

Proposals in the Temperature Check Space will be archived after fifty-six (56) days.

:::tip
If you need help uploading a proposal to Snapshot, tag a contributor in [Discord](https://discord.gg/movexyz).

## Phase 2: Consensus.

Every 28 days, proposals with at least 30 "For" votes in the [Temperature Check Space](https://snapshot.org/#/movedao.eth) are moved to the DAO's [Consensus Space](https://snapshot.org/#/snapshot.movedao.eth) for seven (7) days of voting.

In the Consensus Space, addresses receive one vote per dollar contributed to the [Multi-sig](multisig) from [February-July 2022](/dao/governance/gnosis) inclusive.

As the DAO's Service Provider, [dao-lawfirm.eth](https://dao-lawfirm.xyz/) maintains the right to revoke Consensus proposals which are malicious, exploitative, or otherwise in bad faith.

## Phase 3: Execution.

Once voting closes, proposals with at least 66% approval are queued for execution by the [Multi-sig](multisig). "Abstain" votes are not included in this calculation.

## Emergency Governance.

In an emergency scenario, the [Multi-sig](multisig) can take onchain actions if explicit public approval from 80 percent or more of Multi-sig signers and explicit public approval from dao-lawfirm.eth are received.

**dao-lawfirm.eth must provide a summary and an explanation of any such action(s) within 72 hours of its execution.**
