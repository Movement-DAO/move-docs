Movement DAO is governed by its community, as expressed throu7oiuy
2210 h MAPE voting (mainnet:[`0xdd407a053fa45172079916431d06E8e07f655042`](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdd407a053fa45172079916431d06e8e07f655042)).

[Multisig](multisig) transactions and signatures, as well as updates to DAO processes, must be ratified by this process prior to implementation.

## Phase 0: Discussion

Authors are encouraged to create a proposal discussion thread in the `#✍️｜proposal-workshop` channel of the [Movement DAO Discord](https://discord.gg/movexyz). Community members are encouraged to provide feedback.

:::tip
You can use the [proposal template](template) as a starting point. When writing your proposal, try to be as detailed as possible in your specification. Only include what is necessary—short, specific proposals are best.
:::

## Phase 1: Temperature Check

Once finalized, authors can submit their proposals to Movement DAO's [Temperature Check Space](https://snapshot.org/#/movedao.eth). The Temperature Check Space grants one vote to each MAPE holder.

As the DAO's Service Provider, [dao-lawfirm.eth](https://dao-lawfirm.xyz/) maintains the right to revoke Temperature Check proposals which are malicious, exploitative, or otherwise in bad faith.

Proposals in the Temperature Check Space will be archived after 56 days.

## Phase 2: Consensus

**Every 28 days, proposals with at least 30 "For" votes** in the [Temperature Check Space](https://snapshot.org/#/movedao.eth) are moved to the DAO's [Consensus Space](https://snapshot.org/#/snapshot.movedao.eth) for seven days of voting.

In the Consensus Space, addresses receive one vote per dollar donated to the the [Multisig](multisig) from February-July 2022 inclusive. 

As the DAO's Service Provider, [dao-lawfirm.eth](https://dao-lawfirm.xyz/) maintains the right to revoke Consensus proposals which are malicious, exploitative, or otherwise in bad faith.

## Phase 3: Execution

Once voting closes, proposals with at least 66% approval are queued for execution by the [Multisig](multisig). "Abstain" votes are not included in this calculation.

## Emergency Governance

In an emergency scenario, the [Multisig](multisig) can take onchain actions if explicit public approval from 80 percent or more of Multisig signers and explicit public approval from dao-lawfirm.eth are received.

dao-lawfirm.eth must provide a summary and an explanation of any such action within 72 hours of its execution.
