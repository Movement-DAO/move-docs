## Background

On or about December 1, 2021, dao-lawfirm.eth began representing a dozen private individuals who collectively expressed interest to experiment with the thesis:

Could a new type of application framework, relying on smart contracts for organizational governance and accounting, operate in a completely decentralized way? Could decentralized applications and smart contracts facilitate greater change than traditional tools when addressing the needs of individuals and scaling to millions of communities?

From February 2-16 2022, almost 99 externally owned addresses and Gnosis Safes seeded over $15m into the [DAO Gnosis safe](https://etherscan.io/address/0x143cC0A996De329C1C5723Ee4F15D2a40c1203c6). This represented an initial commitment to the DAO's vision. dao-lawfirm.eth acted as a connector, bringing together individuals from the worlds of law, economics, traditional finance, non-profit organizations, for-profit organizations, government enforcement, interface design, and blockchain engineering to assemble a plan to enable this vision.

The following wishes were conveyed:
1. dao-lawfirm.eth will retain a veto right in order to protect governance during the "slow-start".
2. The DAO values the privacy and work of its members.
3. The DAO shall recommend a wrapped structure to ensure compliance to applicable laws and regulations.
4. Accounting and governance must be implemented prior to consistent access to capital.
5. There shall be no information asymmetry regarding any governance process.

In order to achieve these wishes, the following steps were taken:
1. dao-lawfirm.eth created trusts and Gnosis Safes to fund the DAO.
2. Multisig signers were appointed and funds were secured to support the DAO until sufficient tooling could be deployed.
3. Proposals for payouts to individuals were limited to 3 months periods.

Initially, the Multisig threshold was set to 3 of 5 signers, and the following signers were appointed:

| ID  | Ethereum Address                                                                                                        |  Contribution  | Creation Date | Created By      |

| 2.  | [`0x468f178672C86bFA02e5E1B0413C3ccf55A37409`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x468f178672C86bFA02e5E1B0413C3ccf55A37409) |                | 2021-12-17    | dao-lawfirm.eth |

Future multisig reconfigurations are subject to the DAO governance process.

## Additional Considerations

### MAPE NFTs

In order to invite thought leadership and reward decentralized governance pioneers, the purchase of the Bored Ape No. 1420 was approved, upon which a [derivative collection](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdd407a053fa45172079916431d06E8e07f655042) was created and distributed to reward early Discord participants, proposal authors, and voters.[^1]

### Treasury Oversight

As of August 2022, the DAO's [Gnosis Safe](/peace/governance/multisig) had not yet meaningfully utilized staking, yield, or asset diversification. The DAO should appoint a treasury committee where individuals with prior experience managing at least $1,000,000 worth of cryptocurrency over an extended length of time can make written recommendations to the DAO. Community/contributor recommendations endorsed by committee memberis should also be considered.

### Initial Signer Requests

The initial signers, through dao-lawfirm.eth, have made specific requests including:

- Building multi-token Juicebox Protocol treasuries.
- Expanding the [DAO's multisig](/peace/governance/multisig).
- Working towards on-chain governance.

Governance migration to escrowed voting is key, as the endowment contributors have no other way to signal long-term commitments to the DAO. The initial signers provided 60 days during which to present a timeline for the version 1.0 release of the DAO tooling to the community.

[^1]: [Movement DAO's Ascended Ape Collection](https://opensea.io/collection/movement-daos-ascended-ape-collection), as of August 10, 2022, there are 1.1k owners. While all of the original Gnosis contributors were airdropped NFTs, the DAO's governance proposal and temperature-check Snapshot voting strategy relies exclusively on the NFT while the proposal ratification strategy is a weighted whitelist based on contributions to the Gnosis.
