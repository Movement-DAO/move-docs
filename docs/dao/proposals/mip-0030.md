## Thesis.

This proposal seeks to establish a special litigation committee ("Committee") for Movement DAO, driven by the following key objectives:

1. **Supervision and Decision Ratification**: The Committee's foremost role is to oversee, offer guidance, and formally approve decisions taken by the Authorized Members **tankbottoms.eth** and **benreed.eth**. These decisions pertain to the resolution of claims involving the DAO, whether they are asserted for or against it.
2. **Empowering Authorized Members**: The Committee is empowered to grant the Authorized Members the authority to engage in discussions and propose settlement terms with former Members of the DAO who have initiated legal claims (identified by Southern District of Florida Case No. 23-cv-20727) ("Claims") against the Authorized Members.

The DAO previously voted to ratify the filing of counterclaims through [MIP-0027](https://docs.move.xyz/daolabs/daos/move/proposals/mip-0027.md).

The purpose of the Committee will be to maintain transparency, accountability, and fairness with regards to any settlement offers regarding the Claims.

_Please note that this proposal is not intended to replace the community governance process. Instead, its purpose is to appoint a Committee that will offer guidance to the Authorized Members. The Committee will also monitor settlement communications, which are generally non-public and often inadmissible in court proceedings[^1]. The objective is to enhance transparency and alignment with the DAO's Guiding Principles, Code of Conduct, as well as its broader philosophy and intentions._

### Background.

As a result of the [Authorized Members' decision to terminate the Plaintiff's membership in the DAO](https://docs.move.xyz/daolabs/daos/move/meeting/20230131.md), the Plaintiffs initiated legal proceedings against the Authorized Members as individuals. They also demanded the return of the **entire DAO treasury (including every Member's contribution)**. (see footnote 8) This situation prompted the Authorized Members to allocate substantial personal resources to defend themselves and the DAO. For context, the DAO was initially championed by the Plaintiffs using the pseudonym "**John Galt**," who "**donat[ed] millions to Movement** ..., locked his 20% tokens", and the "**capital [was] meant to support the longevity and prosperity of Movement**", so that "**the wisdom of the crowd can save the world**"[^2]. For a more comprehensive understanding of the Plaintiffs' actions, please refer to the [Movement DAO Counterclaim](https://gov.move.xyz/pdf/mip-0027-002.pdf). If you're interested in delving into the specifics of the ongoing legal proceedings, we prepared a [blog post](https://docs.move.xyz/daolabs/blog/20230201.md) to keep the community informed. This post was published on February 3, 2023.

The Authorized Members have expressed concern that despite the explicit formation of the DAO as an Unincorporated Non-Profit Association [MIP-0000](https://docs.move.xyz/daolabs/daos/move/proposals/mip-0000.md), which Plaintiffs approved and ratified on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/snapshot.movedao.eth/proposal/0xf8c8fb501e4076f07c75ef428ac97d851cc4cbad23bc62a873d1d5e2eb014ae5). Plaintiffs have advanced through [litigation](https://docs.move.xyz/pdfs/mips/attachments/mip-0027-001-20230223-verified-complaint.pdf) that the DAO contribution was an "**investment**", and therefore a security.[^4] Plaintiffs may be seeking to expand the scope of the ongoing SEC Probe.[^5] Nonetheless, this is a position that the DAO and its Members have wholly and consistently rejected.[^6]

Citing from the original GitBook, authored by Plaintiffs',

_"[DAO's] Governance tokens are not to be deemed or interpreted to be representative of any kind of: Currency, legal tender, money or deposit, Investment (whether secured or unsecured), equity interest, proprietary interest and economic rights, Equity, debt or hybrid instrument, security collective investment scheme managed fund, financial derivative, futures contract, deposit, commercial paper, negotiable instrument, investment contract, note, bond, warrant, certificate or instrument entitling the holder to interest, dividends or any kind of return, nor any other financial instrument; or...Right, title, interest or benefit whatsoever in whole or in part, in any person or property, or any assets. [The DAO's] Governance tokens are not guaranteed or secured by any person, asset or entity in any way. The team is not under any obligation to issue replacement tokens if they are lost, stolen, destroyed, or otherwise inaccessible for any reason."(emphasis added)_[^7]

The Authorized Members are concerned that the Plaintiffs' position may be used to justify the seizure of the DAO's assets, which would be detrimental to the DAO's operations and the community. Plaintiffs' position is contrary to all documentation published (or unpublished) by the DAO's members, as recorded in Git with regards to GitBook, website, Snapshot governance proposals, the Token Terms of Use, and Terms of Service.[^8]

## Motivation.

DAOs are designed to be transparent, secure, and autonomous. However, the Complaint was brought against the Authorized Members of the DAO as individuals for the actions they took to **protect the DAO against being "rugged"**. The Plaintiffs fabricated allegations against **tankbottoms.eth** and **benreed.eth**, which in turn compelled **tankbottoms.eth** and **benreed.eth** to dedicate substantial resources toward the defense of the DAO, its members, and its creditors.

Following consultations with the [Emergency Committee on January 31, 2023](https://docs.move.xyz/daolabs/daos/move/meeting/20230131.md), the Authorized Members and the Emergency Committee resolved to evaluate the feasibility of enabling a token redemption process of a portion of the DAO's Treasury. This initiative aimed to provide equal opportunities for both the Plaintiffs and all DAO contributors to redeem a portion of their contributions[^3], while still leaving enough funds in the treasury to allow the DAO to continue to build out the Dapp. Despite publicly signaling the intention to facilitate such a redemption process, the Plaintiff's legal representatives chose to persist with slandering through litigation and **demand the entire treasury, without regard to the DAO's obligations**.

The Authorized Members have firmly communicated to the Plaintiffs the impracticality of prolonging the litigation and emphasized the necessity of reaching a quantified settlement. The primary objectives of the Authorized Members are as follows:

1. Fulfill all obligations of the DAO by settling outstanding matters and fulfilling payments;
2. Mitigate any potential future legal liabilities for both the DAO and its members; and
3. Uphold ethical conduct. Neither the Authorized Members nor the DAO's Members who have voiced their opinion aim to retain the Plaintiffs' donated funds beyond what's essential for the team's ongoing development of the Dapp.

## Anonymity.

Certain Committee members are anonymous and have not been disclosed to the community. This is to protect the identity of the Committee members, and to prevent any undue influence or pressure from external parties. For example, Plaintiff's attorneys have leveled allegations accusing certain Members of Racketeering, notified Coinbase to halt any cryptocurrency transactions, and threatened to include individuals providing services to the DAO in future litigation.[^9]

## Specification.

The Committee will comprise a maximum of seven (7) individuals, selected from those with a wealth of experience in areas like development, governance, and DAO operations. Preference will be given to those who possess a background in litigation and/or had involvement in the initial Emergency Committee in January 2023. Ideally, Committee members should possess insight into the relevant parties, the history of the DAO's formation, and the capacity to exercise sound business judgment. The Committee's term is projected to extend until the resolution of the ongoing matter.

The following ETH addresses/individuals make up the initial members of the Committee:

The Committee's functions are as follows::

1. Initial approval of the equivalent of up to [$8,500,000.00 in DAI/ETH](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x143cC0A996De329C1C5723Ee4F15D2a40c1203c6) in a proposed settlement offer with Plaintiffs;
2. Authorization of any settlement amount exceeding the aforementioned amount;
3. Authorization of any additional terms in the settlement beyond the amount of funds;
4. Authorization for the [Signers](https://snapshot.org/#/snapshot.movedao.eth/proposal/0x3b9786ef326b3df1e943c0ad02731f983bd11b5c931e42bf3a3ada35aebe7839) to execute the settlement transaction;
5. Oversight and ratification for any ongoing DAO expenses exceeding $10,000.00 USD;
6. Maintain records of all expenses and provide a quarterly report of such expenses;
7. Oversight of the DAO's tokenomics and membership criteria changes;
8. Oversight, investigations, and resolution of any outstanding claims made against the DAO, its contributors, or Members.[^10] The Committee will investigate all allegations, claims, and matters brought before it as it relates to any facts raised by the litigation. The Committee will conduct a thorough investigation on any claim to determine its validity, and then provide proposals and guidance on the appropriate actions to be taken. The proposed actions from the Committee will be put up for approval via Snapshot vote.
9. Recommending other security precautions and measures deemed necessary by the Committee to ensure the DAO's integrity and trustworthiness - similar to the [Nouns](https://nouns.wtf/) "Slow Start", protecting the governance process and navigating non-trivial legal or existential risks both from untrustworthy actors, critical smart contract vulnerabilities, Snapshot voting manipulations, or other risks that may arise.

## Rationale.

Establishing a Committee on behalf of the DAO to oversee and advise the Authorized Members on the potential settlement regarding the Complaint ensures transparency and accountability in the agreed upon terms of the settlement, prevents the misuse of settlement funds, and reduces the risk of fraud and manipulation. It also protects the interests of the Members and ensure their representation in the settlement preceding and promotes trust and confidence in the DAO's governance structure. Providing oversight on legal and settlement decisions is also essential to ensure that the DAO operates in line with its [Guiding Principles](https://docs.move.xyz/pdfs/mips/attachments/mip-0028-004-20230515-guiding-principles-updated.pdf) and [Code of Conduct](https://docs.move.xyz/pdfs/mips/attachments/mip-0028-006-20230515-code-of-conduct-updated.pdf).

## Risks.

There are some risks associated with establishing a Committee within the DAO. The Committee members may have conflicting interests or biases that could influence their decision-making. The Committee's decisions may also be subject to manipulation or influence by external parties. The Committee members may not have the most current facts as it relates to the outstanding litigation.

Therefore, it is essential to select Committee members with integrity and independence and establish clear rules and procedures for their operations. Additionally, the Committee's decisions must be transparent and subject to review by the Members. The Committee's oversight on legal decisions must also be balanced and not unduly restrictive.

## Snapshot Consensus by the DAO Members.

Whereas the DAO through its Members voted to adopt the following actions via Snapshot and resolves as follows:

**RESOLVED:** Movement will establish a Committee to oversee legal and settlement decisions as it relates to claims involving the DAO, whether they are asserted for or against it;

**RESOLVED FURTHER:** the Committee authorizes **tankbottoms.eth** and **benreed.eth**, to engage in settlement discussions and negotiations, and accept final terms with former members of the DAO, the Plaintiffs;

**RESOLVED FURTHER:** That the Authorized Members convened and are hereby jointly and severally authorized to take any and all actions, along with executing or signing any cryptocurrency transactions, and executing and delivering any other documents, agreements, instruments, and/or certificates as he or she may deem necessary, advisable, or incidental, in connection with the preceding resolution, and other resolutions herein, or any related documents. This also includes authorization to perform or resolve the obligations of the DAO, and/or its affiliates.

This approval by the DAO Members by Snapshot vote shall be effective as of the date the DAO Entities receives a majority vote of the DAO at the end of the Snapshot vote.

This action by the DAO may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original and all of which together shall constitute one action.
