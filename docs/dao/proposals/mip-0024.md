# Member Notice of Authorized DAO Resources

```
Authors: benreed.eth
Date: 2023-05-02
Proposal: 0024
Type: Notice
```

## Thesis.

To ensure Movement DAO's members and contributors are aware of important changes to the DAO's official links for certain online properties, Authorized Members tankbottoms.eth and benreed.eth are verifying which DAO links and online properties the community should use. By updating the official links, the Authorized Members seek to minimize potential confusion, prevent the spread of misinformation, streamline communications to the community, and ensure the DAO operates accurately and transparently.

## Motivation.

Recent actions taken by former founding members of Movement DAO (hereafter the "DAO") have intentionally restricted and blocked administrative access of other core community members to certain DAO applications and online properties. As a result, these properties can no longer be relied upon and trusted by the community as an accurate source of information from the DAO. Therefore the Authorized Members desire to fully notify the DAO community of enacted changes to official DAO links which will allow the DAO and its members to freely engage with one another, consolidate core messaging and communications under the IRL affiliate, DAOLABS, and retire unverified and outdated applications and online properties.

## Specification.

This section is intentionally left blank.

**Updated** and **consolidated** DAO resources under DAOLABS:

Movement DAO and other DAOs under the Movement DAO or DAOLABS umbrella will be hosted within channels or subdomains of the following online properties.

1. Discord Server
   a. [https://discord.com/daolabs](https://discord.com/channels/1073360258531082240/1078118591863468132)
2. Social Media
   b. [https://twitter.com/daolabs_wtf](https://twitter.com/daolabs_wtf)
3. Development Website
   c. [https://daolabs-nft-tooling.on.fleek.co](https://daolabs-nft-tooling.on.fleek.co)
4. Documentation, Governance, Legal Templates
   d. [https://daolabs-docs.on.fleek.co](https://daolabs-docs.on.fleek.co)

### Retired and Unverified links:

The following links can **no longer be trusted** for their accuracy and should not be used or interacted with by Movement DAO members and contributors:

1. Discord Server: [https://discord.gg/movexyz](https://discord.gg/movexyz) [^1]
2. Social Media: [https://twitter.com/move_xyz](https://twitter.com/move_xyz) [^2]
3. Podcast: [Podbean](https://movementdaopodcast.podbean.com/)
4. Notion: [Notion](https://www.notion.so/movedao) _(Internal content repository & project management)_
5. Instagram: [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/movedao.eth/) [^3]

## Rationale.

The DAO's links were updated for the following reasons:

-   To inform DAO members and contributors of recent changes to the DAO's messaging and communication channels;
-   To ensure the community continues to freely engage with one another; and,
-   To reduce the chance of misinformation, censorship, and/or torturous interference with DAO operations by recently removed founding members.

## Risks.

-   There could be better avenues of communication;
-   Historical context is lost when changing Discord servers;
-   Former online properties still exist and could be used by bad actors to inflict harm on the DAO; and,
-   Lack of brand clarity could confuse less informed community members.

## Snapshot Consensus by the DAO Members.

Whereas the DAO through its Members voted to adopt the following actions via Snapshot and resolves as follows:

**RESOLVED:** That the DAO broadly notifies its members and contributors about important changes to the DAO's official links through governance notices via Snapshot;

**RESOLVED FURTHER:** That the Authorized Members convened and are hereby jointly and severally authorized to take any and all actions, along with executing or signing any cryptocurrency transactions, and executing and delivering any other documents, agreements, instruments, and/or certificates as he or she may deem necessary, advisable, or incidental, in connection with the preceding resolution, and other resolutions herein, or any related documents. This also includes authorization to perform or resolve the obligations of the DAO, and/or its affiliates.

This approval by the DAO Members by Snapshot vote shall be effective as of the date the DAO Entities receives a majority vote of the DAO at the end of the Snapshot vote.

This action by the DAO may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original and all of which together shall constitute one action.
